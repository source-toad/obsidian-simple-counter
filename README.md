# Simple Counter

This is a very basic plugin to have an in-note counter, designed for tracking multiple tallies in a note. 

This project is primarily built for my own purposes, for use in TTRPGs.

## How to Use

Simply put `counter: X` in your note, and it will render as a count, with increment/decrement buttons.
